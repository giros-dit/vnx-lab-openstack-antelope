# Openstack Antelope VNX virtual laboratory

This is an Openstack Antelope (2023.1) tutorial laboratory scenario based on VNX (http://vnx.dit.upm.es). It is designed to experiment with Openstack free and open-source software platform for cloud-computing.
The scenario is made of four virtual machines: a controller node, a network node and two compute nodes, all based on LXC. Optionally, new compute nodes can be added by starting additional VNX scenarios. Openstack version used is Antelope (2023.1) over Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. The deployment scenario is the one that was named "Classic with Open vSwitch" and was described in previous versions of Openstack documentation (https://docs.openstack.org/liberty/networking-guide/scenario-classic-ovs.html). It is prepared to experiment either with the deployment of virtual machines using "Self Service Networks" provided by Openstack, or with the use of external "Provider networks".
